Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{point1_8cpp}{point1.\+cpp}} \\*Contains the resolution of point 1 of Deliverable 1. This program reads an audio file sample by sample and writes it to a new audio file. To use the program, the user must pass two arguments\+: the input file path and the output file path }{\pageref{point1_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{point2_8cpp}{point2.\+cpp}} \\*Contains the resolution of point 2 of Deliverable 1. This program copies a 4\+:4\+:4 video file pixel by pixel. To use the program, the user must pass two arguments\+: the input file path and the output file path }{\pageref{point2_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{point4_8cpp}{point4.\+cpp}} \\*Contains the resolution of point 4 of Deliverable 1. This program reads a .wav audio file and computes the histogram for each possible sample value \mbox{[}-\/2$^\wedge$(15) .. 2$^\wedge$(15)-\/1\mbox{]} }{\pageref{point4_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{point5_8cpp}{point5.\+cpp}} \\*Contains the resolution of point 5 of Deliverable 1. This program reads a 4\+:4\+:4 video file and computes, for each frame, the histogram of three color planes \mbox{[}B,G,R\mbox{]} as well as its grayscale version and its corresponding entropy }{\pageref{point5_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{point6_8cpp}{point6.\+cpp}} \\*Contains the resolution of points 6 and 8 of Deliverable 1. This program reads an audio file in .wav format, applies a quantization algorithm to reduce the number of bits used to represent each audio sample and saves the quantized file. To use the program, the user must pass three arguments\+: the input file path, the output file path and the number of bits to use in the quantizer }{\pageref{point6_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{point7_8cpp}{point7.\+cpp}} \\*Contains the resolution of points 7 and 9 of Deliverable 1. This program reads a video in .y4m format with Y\+U\+V\+\_\+444 color coding and applies a quantization algorithm to reduce the number of bits used to represent each pixel. The program plays both the input and reduced videos. To use the program, the user must pass two arguments\+: the input file path and the number of bits to use in the quantizer }{\pageref{point7_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bfseries sndfile.\+hh} }{\pageref{sndfile_8hh}}{}
