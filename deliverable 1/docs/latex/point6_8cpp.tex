Contains the resolution of points 6 and 8 of Deliverable 1. This program reads an audio file in .wav format, applies a quantization algorithm to reduce the number of bits used to represent each audio sample and saves the quantized file. To use the program, the user must pass three arguments\+: the input file path, the output file path and the number of bits to use in the quantizer.
